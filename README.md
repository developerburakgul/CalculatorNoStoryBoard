# Calculator No StoryBoard

## Project about
- This project is similar to Apple's Calculator but not exactly the same.
- There is no main.StoryBoard.
- UI written programmatic , no third-party library.
- This project's architecture is MVC.
## Missing parts of the project
- Deleting numbers by swiping the screen from right to left.
- Setting backgrounds for operation buttons when clicked.
## Parts of the project that need improvement
- Definitely CalculatorLogic part because this way of writing code does not make sense.
